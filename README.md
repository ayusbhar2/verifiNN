# verifiNN

This project implements a semi-definite programming (SDP) based verification algorithm for Deep Neural Networks from the ground up.

Prerequisites:
- python 3
- virtualenv
- pip

Instructions:
- set up the python virtual enviroment by running `setup.sh`
- add the following entry to the `~/.bash_profile` file ```export PYTHONPATH="<path/to/parent/repo>:$PYTHONPATH"```
- start up the python environment by ```. ./venv/bin/activate```
